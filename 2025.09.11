I was able to see the specifications of my laptop and I discovered new things such as Monitor, Cooling, PSU, CPU, GPU, and many more. I learned about new specifications and also realized that there are many other important features that make a computer powerful and unique.

Additionally, I now understand that every part of a computer — from the processor and graphics card to the cooling system and even the monitor — plays a big role in performance. Exploring these details helps me see how different builds are suited for studying, working, or high-end gaming.
1. Processor (CPU)
	•	Recommended:
	•	Intel Core i7 / i9 (12–16 cores, 24 threads).
	•	AMD Ryzen 7 / 9 (8–16 cores).
	•	Important: high core count and clock speed 4.5–5.5 GHz.
	•	Examples: Intel i7-13700K, Ryzen 7 7800X3D.
2. Graphics Card (GPU)
	•	The most important part for gaming.
	•	Recommended:
	•	NVIDIA RTX 4070 / 4080 / 4090 (for ultra graphics, ray tracing, DLSS).
	•	AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT / XTX.
	•	For 1080p gaming, RTX 4060 Ti is enough, but for 2K/4K gaming — RTX 4070 Ti and above are better.
3. RAM (Memory)
	•	Minimum for gaming: 16 GB DDR4.
	•	Optimal: 32 GB DDR5 (6000–7200 MHz).
	•	Preferably dual-channel (2×16 GB).
4. Storage (SSD/HDD)
	•	System drive: NVMe SSD 1 TB (for Windows and games).
	•	Additional: HDD 2–4 TB (for movies, archives).
	•	SSD is essential — it makes games load 5–10× faster.
5. Motherboard
	•	Support for PCIe 4.0/5.0 (for GPU and SSD).
	•	Strong VRM cooling.
	•	Chipsets: Intel Z690/Z790 or AMD X670/B650.
6. Cooling
	•	For CPU: liquid cooling (AIO 240–360 mm) or a high-end air cooler.
	•	For the case: at least 3–4 fans.
	•	Target temps under load: CPU ≤ 80 °C, GPU ≤ 85 °C.
7. Power Supply (PSU)
	•	Power: 750–1000 W (80+ Gold or Platinum).
	•	For RTX 4090 — better 1000–1200 W.
8. Monitor
	•	Resolution: 2K (1440p) or 4K.
	•	Refresh rate: 144–240 Hz.
	•	Response time: ≤ 1 ms.
	•	Technologies: G-Sync / FreeSync.
9. Peripherals (for gaming)
	•	Keyboard: mechanical (with RGB backlight).
	•	Mouse: high DPI (8000–26000).
	•	Headset: surround sound 7.1.
	•	Gamepad: Xbox or DualSense (optional).
 Example of a Powerful Build (2025)
	•	CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D.
	•	GPU: NVIDIA RTX 4080 Super.
	•	RAM: 32 GB DDR5 (6000 MHz).
	•	SSD: 1 TB NVMe Gen4.
	•	HDD: 2 TB.
	•	PSU: 850 W Gold.
	•	Cooling: 360 mm liquid cooling.
	•	Monitor: 27” 2K, 240 Hz, IPS
